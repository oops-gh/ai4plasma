"""Advanced Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving PDEs and multi-physics problems.

This module implements a flexible and extensible framework for training Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) to solve complex partial differential equations (PDEs) and coupled
multi-physics problems. PINNs embed physics knowledge directly into neural networks through
residual-based loss functions, enabling accurate solutions without requiring large amounts
of labeled training data.

class EquationTerm:
    '''Represents a single physics equation term with its residual function and weight.
    
    This class encapsulates one component of the physics loss function in a PINN model.
    For example, a PDE problem might have separate equation terms for:
    - Interior domain residual (PDE satisfaction)
    - Boundary condition residuals
    - Initial condition residuals
    - Additional constraints or regularization terms
    
    Each term has:
    - A residual function that evaluates how well the network satisfies the equation
    - A weight factor that controls its contribution to the total loss
    - Associated data points where the residual is evaluated
    - Optional DataLoader for batch training on large datasets
    
    Attributes:
    -----------
    name : str
        Unique identifier for this equation term (e.g., 'domain', 'boundary_left', 
        'initial_condition'). Used for logging and loss tracking.
    residual_fn : Callable
        Function with signature: residual_fn(network, data) -> torch.Tensor
        Computes the residual (error) at given data points. Should return a tensor
        where ideally all values are close to zero when the physics is satisfied.
    weight : float
        Multiplicative weight for this loss term. Higher weights make the optimizer
        prioritize satisfying this equation. Typical range: 0.1 to 100.
    data : torch.Tensor
        Input data points where the residual is evaluated. Shape depends on problem
        dimensionality: (N, d) for d-dimensional problems with N points.
    dataloader : DataLoader or None
        PyTorch DataLoader for batch training. Created via create_dataloader() when
        batch training is enabled. None for full-batch training.

        shuffle : bool, optional
            Whether to shuffle the data at each epoch. Default: False.

            - Must maintain computational graph for backpropagation
            
            Implementation Tips:

        '''
        Enable or disable adaptive weight adjustment during training.
        
        Adaptive weighting automatically balances different physics equations by
        adjusting their loss weights based on current loss magnitudes. This helps
        prevent one term from dominating the total loss and ensures all constraints
        are satisfied. Particularly useful for:
        - Multi-physics problems with equations of different scales
        - Problems where loss magnitudes vary significantly between terms
        - Avoiding manual tuning of loss weights
        - Curriculum learning where priorities change during training
        
        The adaptive weight for each term is computed as:
            new_weight = current_weight * (average_loss / current_term_loss)
        
        This inverse scaling ensures that equations with larger residuals get
        higher weights to encourage the optimizer to satisfy them better.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        enable : bool, optional
            Whether to enable adaptive weighting. Default: True
            - True: Enable adaptive weight adjustments

            Frequency of weight updates in epochs. Default: 10
            - The weights are updated every N epochs
            - Larger values = less frequent updates (more stable training)

        that all physics equations contribute roughly equally to the total loss,
        preventing any single term from dominating optimization.

        Register a visualization callback to be executed during training.
        
        Visualization callbacks enable real-time plotting and analysis during training
        without modifying the core training loop. Useful for:
        - Monitoring solution evolution over training
        - Comparing predicted vs analytical solutions
        - Visualizing residuals and error distributions
        - Creating animations of training progress
        - Tracking problem-specific metrics
        
        The callback's visualize() method is called periodically (every log_freq epochs)
        and the returned figures are automatically logged to TensorBoard.
        
        Parameters:
        -----------
        callback : VisualizationCallback
            Visualization callback instance. Must be a subclass of VisualizationCallback
            and implement the visualize() method.
            The callback should define:
            - name: unique identifier for the callback
            - log_freq: execution frequency (every N epochs)
